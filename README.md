![Workflow result](https://github.com/dambakk/Countdowner/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
A simple countdown timer app written in Jetpack Compose to try out the animations API.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The circles are made using Canvas and animated using path clipping and `animateFloatAsState`. That
was a fun exercise.
